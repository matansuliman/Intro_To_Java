# Intro to JAVA

# Triangle1:
## input:
* length of 3 vertices of a triangle.
* the length is a natural number {1,2,3,4,...}
* the numbers must be able to form a triangle.
## output:
* the perimeter and area of the triangle.
* the program uses Herons formula: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula


# Triangle2:
## input:
* length of 3 vertices of a triangle.
* the length is a natural number {1,2,3,4,...}
## output:
* what type of triangle these verticies form, if at all.
* there are 4 types of triangles:
  * equilateral - all verticies are equal
  * isosceles - two verticis equal and the third not.
  * right-angle - by the Pythagorean theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem
  * common - any other triangle type.
